<p>When I was a kid, my mom had a Canon AE-1 Program 35mm film camera. She loved it, took it everywhere, and used it to capture some of my favorite childhood snapshots. Eventually, my dad bought her a newer Nikon with a built-in flash, so the AE-1 saw less and less action before ending up in a drawer.</p>

				     <p>My parents sold my childhood home back in 2012, and that's the last time I remember seeing my mom's old camera. I've moved a few times since then and it's never turned up, so I gave up on it and resigned myself to my iPhone.</p>

				    <p>In May 2016, the Canon turned up in an otherwise useless box in my friend's parents' garage. I've been firing away with it ever since. Most of the first few rolls were useless and blown out, but it's an extremely forgiving beginner camera. Every now and again, when the light is just right...</p>
